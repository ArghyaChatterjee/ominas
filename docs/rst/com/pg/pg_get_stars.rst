pg\_get\_stars.pro
===================================================================================================









	Obtain star descriptors for the given data descriptor.



	If /override, then a star descriptor is created and initialized
	using the specified values.  Otherwise, the descriptor is obtained
	through the translators.  Note that if /override is not used,
	values (except name) can still be overridden by specifying
	them as keyword parameters.  If name is specified, then
	only descriptors corresponding to those names will be returned.
