GRIM Command-Line Interface
===========================

The grim command-line interface allows the user to manipulate data sets
alongside GRIM.  INGRID may be used to obtain and replace GRIM's descriptors
for use with other programs, or on the command line, and GR_DRAW applies new 
GRIM overlays.  GRIM monitors events on all of the descriptors that it maintains,
so modifcations to any of those descriptors are immediately acted on in GRIM.
