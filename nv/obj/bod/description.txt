BODY Object Class
=================

 The BODY object class describes the position and orientation of a rigid body
 in space.  It is an immediate subclass of CORE.


Coordinate systems
------------------
 - Inertial
	Cartesian coordinate system used as the celestial reference frame.

 - Body
	Cartesian coordinate system centered on and fixed to the body.

 - Radec
	Polar coordinate system centered on and fixed to the body.  Vectors
	are given as [ra, dec, r], where ra = right ascension, 
	dec = declination, and r = radial distance.


Data objects
------------
 - orientation matrix
	The orientation matrix transforms vectors given in the body coordinate
	system to vectors given in the inertial coordinate system (using the 
	IDL ## matrix operator).  Its form is

				 b0x  b1x  b2x 
				 b0y  b1y  b2y 
				 b0z  b1z  b2z , 

	where the body axis vectors are b0=[b0x,b0y,b0z], b1=[b1x,b1y,b1z],
	and b2=[b2x,b2y,b2z], with components given with respect to the
	inertial system.


				 b2
				| 
				|  / b1
				| /
				|/
				 ------- b0

	The interpretation of the body coordinate axes depends on the
	superclass of of which it is a part.
			


 - position vector
	The position vector gives the position of the body, with components 
	in the inertial coordinate system.


 - body descriptor
	The body descriptor is the class structure for the BODY class.  
	See body_descriptor__define.



Coordinate Transformation Variations
------------------------------------
Methods are provided to transform between adjacent coordinate systems, e.g., 
inertial<-->body, body<-->radec.  The basic methods transform pure vectors (i.e.,
they perform rotations).  However, two alternate forms are provided to transform
position and velocity vectors.  Those variants include a translation in addition
to the rotation.  They are identical; separate methods are provided for clarity.
