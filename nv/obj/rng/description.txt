RING Object Class
=================

 The RING object class describes planetary rings.  It is an immediate
 subclass of DISK.


Coordinate systems
------------------
 - Inertial
	Cartesian coordinate system used as the celestial reference frame.

 - Body
	Cartesian coordinate system centered on and fixed to the body.  This
	coordinate system is inherited from BODY.

 - Disk
	Cylindrical coordinate system defined with respect to the ringplane.
	This coordinate system is inherited from DISK.


Data objects
------------
 - orientation matrix
	The orientation matrix is inherited from BODY.  Th b2 axis corresponds
	to the normal to the plane of the ring and the b0 axis gives the zero
	direction of disk longitude as shown.

				| b2 --> ringplane normal
				|
				|
				|_______
			       /        b1
			      /
			     / b0 --> disk longitude=0


 -  position vector
	The position vector is inherited from BODY.  It gives the position of
	the ring center with respect to the inertial coordinate system.


 - ring descriptor
	The ring descriptor is the class structure for the RING class.  
	See ring_descriptor__define.
