POINT object
============

  The POINT object describes an array of points. A single POINT object contains 
  an array of image points and their corresponding inertial vectors, if 
  applicable.  In addition, there is a flag array providing a bit-mask for each
  point.

  The points array is (2,nv,nt) and the vectors array is (nv,3,nt), where nv is
  the number of points or vectors and nt is the number of timesteps.  There is
  a one-to-one correspondence between image points and inertial vectors.

  The flags array is long (nv,nt), with one flag word for each point. 
  This allows for 32 1-bit flags per point.  The flag masks are defined in
  pgs_include.pro.

  The data array and tags are determined by the program.  Generally, the data
  array is (nv,nd) or (nv,nt,nd), where nd is the number of different
  data values per point.  The tags array is generally a string array (nd), 
  whose purpose is to allow other programs to find these output values
  without requiring the user to deal with long argument lists.
