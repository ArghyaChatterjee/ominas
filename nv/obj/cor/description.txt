CORE Object Class
=================

 The CORE object class is the superclass of all other object classes.  In 
 addition to storing some fundamental properties like "name", CORE manages
 the task list, user data arrays, and the generic descriptor.


Data objects
------------
 - core descriptor
	The core descriptor is the class structure for the CORE class.  
	See core_descriptor__define.


 - task list
	The core descriptor maintains a list of the names of every program 
	that has modified this descriptor.  A program that modifies the 
	descriptor should call cor_add_task to add its name to the list 
	immediately after it has modified the descriptor.  Tasks cannot be 
	removed from the list.


 - user data
	The core descriptor maintains a list of user-generated named
	data objects.

 - generic desscriptor
	Structure containing references to all assciated descriptors.
