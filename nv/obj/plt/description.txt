PLANET Object Class
===================

 The PLANET object class describes the substellar objects such as planets and
 satellites.  It is an immediate subclass of GLOBE.


Coordinate systems
------------------
 - Inertial
	Cartesian coordinate system used as the celestial reference frame.

 - Body
	Rotating cartesian coordinate system centered on and fixed to the body. 
	This coordinate system is inherited from BODY.

 - Globe
	Rotating spherical coordinate system defined with respect to the 
	surface of the planet.  This coordinate system is inherited from GLOBE.


Data objects
------------
 - orientation matrix
	The orientation matrix is inherited from BODY.  Th b2 axis corresponds
	to the rotation axis and the b0 axis gives the zero direction of
	longitude as shown.

				| b2 --> rotation axis, latitude = pi/2
				|
				|
				|_______
			       /        b1
			      /
			     / b0 --> longitude = 0


 -  position vector
	The position vector is inherited from BODY.  It gives the position of
	the planet center with respect to the inertial coordinate system.


 - planet descriptor
	The planet descriptor is the class structure for the PLANET class.  
	See planet_descriptor__define.
