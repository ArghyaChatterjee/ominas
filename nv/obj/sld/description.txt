SOLID Object Class
==================

 The SOLID object class describes common attributes of three-dimensional bodies.  
 It is an immediate subclass of BODY.


Coordinate systems
------------------
 - Inertial
	Cartesian coordinate system used as the celestial reference frame.

 - Body
	Cartesian coordinate system centered on and fixed to the body.  This
	coordinate system is inherited from BODY.


Data objects
------------
 - orientation matrix
	The orientation matrix is inherited from BODY.  The b2 axis corresponds
	to latitude=pi/2 and the b0 axis corresponds to longitude=0, as shown.


				 b2 --> latitude = pi/2
				| 
				|  / b1
				| /
				|/
				 ------- b0 --> longitude = 0
			


 - position vector
	The position vector is inherited from BODY.  It gives the position of
	the body center with respect to the inertial coordinate system.


 - solid descriptor
	The solid descriptor is the class structure for the SOLID class.  
	See solid_descriptor__define.
