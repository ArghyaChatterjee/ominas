CAMERA Object Class
===================
						  
 The CAMERA object class describes instruments that produce raster images.
 Linear, radial, and polynomial distortion models are built in, but any 
 distortion model may be specified.  CAMERA is an immediate subclass of BODY.


Coordinate systems
------------------
 - Inertial
	Cartesian coordinate system used as the celestial reference frame.

 - Body
	Cartesian coordinate system centered on and fixed to the body.  
	Inherited from BODY.

 - Focal Plane
	Cartesian coordinate system specifying locations in the
	focal plane as (p,q), where p and q are given in radians, and the
	distance from the origin to the point (p,q) is equal to the angle
	between the optic axis and a vector from the camera position to 
	the point.

 - Image
	Cartesian coordinate system specfiying locations in a
	two-dimensional image as (x,y), with origin (0,0) at the lower left
	corner (minimum sample, maximum line) of the image and x and y
	increasing in the increasing sample and decreasing line directions,
	respectively.



Data objects
------------
 - orientation matrix
	The orientation matrix is inherited from BODY.  The b1 axis corresponds
	to the camera optic axis and the b0 and b2 axes points in the image
	x and y directions respectively.


				 b2 = image y direction
				| 
				|  / b1 = optic axis
				| /
				|/
				 ------- b0 = image x direction
			


 - position vector
	The position vector is inherited from BODY.  It gives the position of
	the camera with respect to the inertial coordinate system.


 - camera descriptor
	The camera descriptor is the class structure for the CAMERA class.  
	See camera_descriptor__define.
