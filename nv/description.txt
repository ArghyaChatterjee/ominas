OMINAS Core
==========

The core OMINAS code is independent of data sources and file types.  Those
details are configured based on the intended purpose of a particular OMINAS
installation.  For example, the Cassini ISS installation contains configuration
code that reads and writes VICAR image files and SPICE kernels.  These I/O
functions are implemented by the OMINAS core I/O system.

The separation between the data processing and I/O is maintained by a
portion of the OMINAS system called NV.  NV uses application-specific
configuration tables to determine how to transform ancillary data from 
external sources into the standard data objects recognized in OMINAS.

The OMINAS object library defines and manipulates the the basic data objects
used to describe the various entities -- cameras, planets, rings, etc., -- of
interest to the user.  

The typical OMINAS user will operate at the command level, which consists of the
image display program tvim, the NV I/O commands nv_read and nv_write, and a set
of programs based on the underlying object library and utility routines
referred to as PG.  

The graphical interface to OMINAS is called GRIM.  Although it's designed to be
used along with the command line like a fancy TVIM, GRIM may be used on its own.
